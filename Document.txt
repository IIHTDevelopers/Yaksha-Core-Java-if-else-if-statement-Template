Project Overview
This assessment focuses on evaluating participants' ability to use the if-else-if statement in Java for implementing conditional logic. Unlike the "if-else" assessments, this project explicitly requires the use of if-else-if statements. Participants will solve tasks by using if-else-if to handle multiple conditions.

Learning Objectives
After completing this assessment, participants will be able to:

Implement decision-making logic using the if-else-if statement.
Structure conditions with if-else-if to handle multiple scenarios.
Develop programs that solve real-world problems using conditional logic with if-else-if.
Assessment Tasks
Task 1: Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero
Write a program to check whether a given integer is positive, negative, or zero using if-else-if statements.

Example:

Input: 0
Output: "The number 0 is zero."
Task 2: Find the Smallest of Three Numbers
Write a program to find the smallest of three given integers using if-else-if statements.

Example:

Input: a=10, b=5, c=15
Output: "The smallest number is: 5"
Task 3: Check if a Number is Divisible by 3, 5, or Both
Write a program to check whether a given integer is divisible by 3, 5, or both using if-else-if statements.

Example:

Input: num=15
Output: "The number 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5."
Task 4: Grade Calculation Based on Marks
Write a program to assign grades to a student based on their marks using if-else-if statements:

90 and above: Grade A
75 to 89: Grade B
50 to 74: Grade C
Below 50: Grade F
Example:

Input: marks=82
Output: "Grade: B"
Task 5: Check Leap Year
Write a program to check whether a given year is a leap year or not using if-else-if statements.

Example:

Input: year=2024
Output: "The year 2024 is a leap year."
